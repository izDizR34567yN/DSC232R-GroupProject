Preprocessing Steps:

1) Getting Summary Statistics for Numeric Attributes 
    - When observing the schema, all attributes assume the string type 
    - Evaluating the above observation allows us to establish which attributes are numeric
    - To explore these attributes, we needed to cast numeric attributes to floats 
    - Summary statistics were generated

2) Handling Missing Data
    - We determined how many null values there are per attribute, and wrote findings to a new file
    - The categorical data was explored to an idea of the distribution of values
